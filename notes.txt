A method can't be manipulated in any other way than calling it, and this implies that its
arguments will be evaluated before the method is executed. This is a consequence of arguments
being passed by value in Java.

Functions are different. One may manipulate functions without evaluating them. And one has
complete control over when the arguments are evaluated. And if a function has several arguments,
they may be evaluated at different time. This may be done through the use of currying.
